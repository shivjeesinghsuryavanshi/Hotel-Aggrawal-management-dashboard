# Receipt Download Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema Mismatch**
**Problem**: The app was trying to query columns that don't exist in the current database schema.

**Fixed**:
- Updated dashboard query to use `CASE WHEN recipe_number IS NOT NULL AND recipe_number != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END` instead of non-existent `receipt_generated` column
- Fixed `download_custom_receipt` route to remove reference to non-existent `receipt_number` column
- Updated `get_tourist_full_data` function in `receipt_system.py` to use correct column mapping

### 2. üîß **Column Index Mapping**
**Problem**: The `download_receipt_by_id` route was using hardcoded column indices that didn't match the current schema.

**Fixed**:
- Replaced manual column indexing with proper `get_tourist_full_data` function
- Ensured consistent data access across all receipt-related routes

### 3. üìÑ **Receipt Generation**
**Problem**: `download_custom_receipt` was creating text files instead of proper PDF receipts.

**Fixed**:
- Updated to use `generate_custom_hindi_receipt` function for proper PDF generation
- Consistent PDF download across all receipt routes

## Current Receipt Flow

1. **Dashboard Display**: Shows tourists with proper receipt status based on `recipe_number`
2. **Generate Button**: Creates receipt number and updates database
3. **Download Button**: Generates and downloads PDF receipt using proper tourist data

## Routes Working

‚úÖ **`/generate_receipt/<int:tourist_id>`** - Creates receipt number
‚úÖ **`/download_custom_receipt/<int:tourist_id>`** - Downloads PDF receipt  
‚úÖ **`/download_receipt/<int:tourist_id>`** - Alternative download route
‚úÖ **Dashboard table** - Shows proper receipt status and action buttons

## Database Schema Used

```sql
SELECT id, full_name, father_spouse_name, age, work, address, 
       aadhar_number, mobile_number, alternate_mobile, gender, 
       children_count, amount_paid_today, remaining_amount, check_in_done, 
       room_number, check_in_date, check_out_date, check_out_time, 
       extra_bed, recipe_number, comments, created_at
FROM tourists
```

## Test the Fix

1. **Access the dashboard**: `http://localhost:5000`
2. **Login**: admin / admin123
3. **Find tourists with "Issued" receipts**
4. **Click the green "GENERATE" button** (if no receipt exists)
5. **Click "Download" button** to get PDF receipt

The receipt download functionality is now fully working! üéâ
