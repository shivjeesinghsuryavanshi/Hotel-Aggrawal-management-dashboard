## What Changed

The hotel receipt format has been simplified from a complex multi-section layout to a clean, single-table format.

### OLD FORMAT (Complex):
- Multiple sections with decorative elements
- Separate tables for Guest Info, Accommodation, and Payment
- Multiple colors and styling
- Icons and decorative borders
- Detailed terms and conditions
- Complex footer with contact info

### NEW FORMAT (Simple):
- Clean, professional header: "AGGARWAL BHAWAN"

- Clear receipt number, date, and time at the top
- All guest, room, and payment details in one organized table
- Simplified footer with essential check-in/check-out times
- More compact and printer-friendly

## Key Features of New Format:

1. **Header**: Simple "AGGARWAL BHAWAN, Haridwar" header
2. **Receipt Info**: Receipt number, date, and time clearly displayed
3. **Single Table**: All information in one easy-to-read table:
   - Guest details (name, father/spouse, mobile, address, ID)
