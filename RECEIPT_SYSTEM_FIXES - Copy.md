# Receipt System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Database Column Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Code was looking for `receipt_number` and `receipt_generated` columns that don't exist
- **Solution**: Updated code to use actual database schema with `recipe_number` column
- **Fixed in**: `generate_receipt_with_number()` and `search_tourists()` functions

### 2. **Missing Receipt Counter Table**
- **Problem**: `receipt_counter` table didn't exist in database
- **Solution**: Created table with proper structure and initialized with starting number 1000
- **Table structure**: 
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE receipt_counter (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    current_number INTEGER DEFAULT 1000,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  )
  ```

### 3. **Search Query Fixes**
- **Problem**: Query was selecting non-existent columns
- **Solution**: Updated SELECT query to match actual database schema
- **Changes**:
  - `receipt_number` → `recipe_number`
  - Removed `receipt_generated` from SELECT
  - Added logic to calculate `receipt_generated` based on `recipe_number` presence

### 4. **Receipt Filter Logic**
- **Problem**: Filter was checking non-existent `receipt_generated` column
- **Solution**: Updated filter to check if `recipe_number` is NULL or empty
- **Logic**:
  - "yes" filter: `recipe_number IS NOT NULL AND recipe_number != ''`
  - "no" filter: `recipe_number IS NULL OR recipe_number = ''`

### 5. **Data Mapping Consistency**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent field mapping between database and application
- **Solution**: Added proper field mapping in search results
- **Added**: `receipt_generated` calculated field based on `recipe_number` presence

## Files Modified:
1. `receipt_system.py` - Main fixes for database queries and field mapping
2. Created `test_receipt_fix.py` - Test script for receipt generation
3. Created `test_search_fix.py` - Test script for search functionality

## Test Results:
✅ Receipt generation working correctly
✅ PDF generation successful  
✅ Search functionality working
✅ Receipt filters working properly
✅ Database operations successful

## Current Status:
The receipt system is now fully functional with:
- Proper database column mapping
- Working receipt number generation
- Functional search and filter system
- PDF receipt generation
- Compatibility between frontend and backend
